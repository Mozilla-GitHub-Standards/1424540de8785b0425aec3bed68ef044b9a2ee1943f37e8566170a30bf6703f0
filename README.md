# WADI Project Tracking
This repository is an experiment in project tracking for the [Web App Developer Initiative](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Apps), a program at Mozilla to popularize emerging web platform capabilities that close functional gaps between web and native apps.

The repository doesn't track the discrete issues (features, enhancements, bugs) within each project, only the projects themselves. It is a kind of meta-tracker for projects.

So it doesn't contain any code, only issues, each of which represents a project that WADI is undertaking (or considering). Milestones identify the time periods within which we expect to complete the projects. Projects that aren't in a milestone are backlogged.
