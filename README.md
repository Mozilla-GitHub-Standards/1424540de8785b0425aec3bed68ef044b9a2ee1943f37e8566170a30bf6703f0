# WADI Project Tracking

This repository is an experiment in project tracking for the [Web App Developer Initiative](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Apps), a program at Mozilla to popularize emerging web platform capabilities that close functional gaps between web and native apps.

The repository doesn't track the discrete issues (features, enhancements, bugs) within each project, only the projects themselves. It is a kind of meta-tracker for projects.

So it doesn't contain code, just issues, each of which represents a project (or idea for a project) that WADI contributors are undertaking (or considering). Milestones identify the time periods within which we expect to complete the projects. Assignees represent project leads. Projects that aren't in a milestone and don't have an assignee are backlogged.

## Using This Repo

For each project (or idea for a project), [submit an issue](https://github.com/mozilla/wadi/issues/new) whose title is the name of the project. In the *Description* field, summarize the project, with links to detailed information like product requirements documents, GitHub repositories, etc. if available.

If the project is underway, and we've committed to completing it by a certain date, then put it into the appropriate *Milestone* and set its *Assignee* to the project lead.

If it's an idea for a project, leave the *Milestone* and *Assignee* fields empty, and use the issue to discuss it with others, updating the description as the idea evolves.
