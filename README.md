# WADI Project Tracking

This repository was an experiment in project tracking for the [Web App Developer Initiative](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Apps), a program at Mozilla to popularize emerging web platform capabilities that close functional gaps between web and native apps.

This repository is now defunct, as the WADI program at Mozilla has ended. It remains available for historical reference.
