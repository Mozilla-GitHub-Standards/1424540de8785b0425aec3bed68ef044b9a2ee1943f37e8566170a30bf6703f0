# WADI Project Tracking

This repository is an experiment in project tracking for the [Web App Developer Initiative](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Apps), a program at Mozilla to popularize emerging web platform capabilities that close functional gaps between web and native apps.

A *project* is an effort to achieve a particular outcome within a specific period of time. An app isn't a project, although the completion of a version of the app may be. In order to be a project, it needs to have a set of goals and a timeline for achieving them.

The repository doesn't track the discrete issues (features, enhancements, bugs) within each project, only the projects themselves. It is a kind of meta-tracker for projects.

So it doesn't contain code, just issues, each of which represents a project (or idea for a project) that WADI contributors are undertaking (or considering). Milestones identify the time periods within which we expect to complete the projects. Assignees represent project leads. Projects that aren't in a milestone and don't have an assignee are backlogged.

## Using This Repo

For each project (or idea for a project), [submit an issue](https://github.com/mozilla/wadi/issues/new) whose title is the name of the project. In the *Description* field, summarize the project, with links to detailed information like product requirements documents, GitHub milestones, etc. if available.

If someone has committed to completing the project by a certain date, then put it into the appropriate *Milestone* and set its *Assignee* to the project lead.

If it's an idea for a project, leave the *Milestone* and *Assignee* fields empty, and use the issue to discuss it with others, updating the description as the idea evolves.
