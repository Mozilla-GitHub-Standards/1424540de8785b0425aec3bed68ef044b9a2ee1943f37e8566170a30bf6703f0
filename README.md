# WADI Project Tracking
This repository is an experiment in project tracking for the [Web App Developer Initiative](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Apps), a program at Mozilla to popularize emerging web platform capabilities that close functional gaps between web and native apps.

The repository doesn't track the discrete issues (features, enhancements, bugs) within each project, only the projects themselves. It is a kind of meta-tracker for projects.

So it doesn't contain any code, only issues, each of which represents a project that WADI is undertaking (or considering). Milestones identify the time periods within which we expect to complete the projects. Projects that aren't in a milestone are backlogged.

For each project you want to track, submit an issue whose title is the name of the project and whose description is a summary of it, with links to more detailed information about the project (product requirements documents, GitHub milestones, Kanban boards, etc.), if available.

It's ok to file an issue for a project that hasn't begun and doesn't have such information! That includes ideas that may or may not turn into projects. Once such a project has begun, and more detailed information is available, edit the issue description to add them.
